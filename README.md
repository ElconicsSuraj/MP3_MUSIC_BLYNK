# MP3_MUSIC_BLYNK
This code will play song using Blynk app
This Arduino sketch controls a setup that includes an ESP32 board interfaced with Blynk and multiple servo motors. It also communicates with a music module using SoftwareSerial.

The sketch accomplishes the following tasks:

Initializes Blynk with provided authentication token, WiFi credentials, and other settings.
Handles Blynk virtual pins to control digital outputs (e.g., V0, V3, V4).
Reads a physical button state and generates a random value for a virtual potentiometer (V1).
Listens for changes on virtual pin V7, simulating play, stop, previous, and next music control actions.
Interfaces with a music module via SoftwareSerial to play audio files based on various commands.
Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed (Blynk, Servo, SoftwareSerial) and adjust the pin assignments according to your hardware setup. Don't forget to create the Blynk template and set up the corresponding widgets in the Blynk app.
